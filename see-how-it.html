                    <strong class="tricolor-gradiant" style="font-size: 40px; text-align: center;">Welcome to Royal Monarch's &#8377; 100 Crore SIP Plan!</strong><br>
                    <p>At Royal Monarch, we believe that achieving significant financial goals is not a myth. With the right strategy, smart investments, and consistent discipline, you can build a portfolio that grows into something extraordinary. Our 100 Crore SIP Plan is designed to show you how a small monthly investment, when combined with the power of compounding, can turn into a massive wealth-building tool.
                        <br><br>Let us take you through the step-by-step process of how you can potentially build ₹100 Crores in 30 years with an initial investment and monthly SIP contributions.
                    </p>

                
                    <div><h3 style="color: #6CC727;" >How Does the &#8377; 100 Crore SIP Plan Work?</h3></div>
                    <p>To make this simple, let’s break down the process:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><b>Initial Lump-Sum Investment:</b>&nbsp We start with an initial investment of ₹50,00,000 (₹50 Lakhs).</li>
                        <li><b>Monthly SIP:</b>&nbsp You start by investing ₹15,000 every month via SIP (Systematic Investment Plan).</li>
                        <li><b>Annual SIP Increase:</b> &nbspEvery year, we increase the SIP amount by 10%. So, after the first year of ₹15,000/month, your SIP for the second year will increase to ₹16,500/month, and so on.</li>
                        <li><b>Annual Return:</b>&nbsp Your investment grows at an annual compounded rate of 18% per year, which significantly boosts your total amount over time.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>This strategy, when followed consistently, will help you accumulate close to ₹100 Crores over a 30-year period. Let’s dive deeper into how this works and why it is so powerful.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Total SIP Invested</strong>: This column shows the total amount you have invested through your SIP contributions over time.</li>
                        <li><strong>Investment Value at 18% Annual Growth</strong>: This is the magical power of compounding at 18% annually. Over time, the returns grow exponentially, leading to the accumulation of nearly ₹100 Crores by the end of 30 years.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div><h3 style="color: #6CC727;">Visualising the Growth with a Chart:</h3><br>
                        <p>To make the growth of your investment even easier to understand, let’s look at how the investment grows over time. The graph below shows the amount you have <b>invested</b> and <b>Investment Value</b> on the Y-axis and the <b>Years</b> on the X-axis.</p>

                    </div>

                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>In the early years, the growth of the investment is slower because the SIP amount is smaller. However, as the SIP increases by 10% every year, your contributions grow along with the compound interest.</li>
                        <li>By Year 10, the growth becomes noticeably steeper.</li>
                        <li>After Year 20 and beyond, the investment value accelerates rapidly due to the high compounding rate (18% per year).</li>
                    </ul>


                    <div><h3 style="color: #6CC727;">Why This Plan Works So Well:</h3></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Compounding at 18%</strong>: Compounding is often called the "8th wonder of the world." The longer your money stays invested, the more it grows exponentially. With an annual return of 18%, your investment multiplies significantly over the years.</li>
                        <li><strong>SIP Increase Every Year</strong>: Increasing your SIP by 10% every year means that your contribution grows as your income or financial capacity improves. This ensures that you continue to increase your investment without feeling burdened.</li>
                        <li><strong>Starting with a Lump Sum</strong>: Starting with ₹50 Lakh right away gives your investment an early boost, and it compounds from Day 1, giving you a head start.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <div><h3 style="color: #6CC727;">How Can You Start?</h3></div>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Initial Investment</strong>: Start with ₹50 Lakh today.</li>
                        <li><strong>Monthly SIP</strong>: Set up an SIP of ₹15,000 per month and let it grow.</li>
                        <li><strong>Increase SIP by 10% Every Year</strong>: Every year, increase your SIP by 10% — simple and easy to do!</li>
                        <li><strong>Sit Back and Watch</strong>: With 18% compounding annually, let your investments work for you over time!</li>

                    </ul>

                    <div><h3 style="color: #6CC727;">Conclusion:</h3></div>
